# Summary

You've completed the lab on building agentic knowledge bases with Azure AI Search. Through 9 progressive notebooks, you explored how retrieval becomes intelligent when guided by a large language model that can plan searches, select sources, and generate grounded responses. Parts 3 and 3B both use SharePoint—Part 3 shows remote (live-permission) retrieval, while Part 3B demonstrates the indexed, high-performance pattern.

## What You Explored

In this lab, you worked with different knowledge base configurations and learned how agentic retrieval differs from traditional search. You connected to multiple data sources, experimented with retrieval strategies, and saw how answer synthesis generates citation-backed responses. You also explored how reasoning effort levels affect performance and accuracy.

## Next Steps

Here are some ways to apply what you've learned:

**Expand your knowledge base** - Connect additional search indexes, SharePoint sites, or web sources to broaden what your system can query.

**Customize retrieval behavior** - Adjust reasoning effort levels, configure custom instructions for specific sources, or experiment with different reranking thresholds.

**Integrate with your data** - Replace the sample HR and health insurance indexes with your own enterprise content.

**Build a user interface** - Create a chat interface or API that uses your knowledge base to answer user questions.

The patterns you explored in this lab form the foundation for building custom copilots, enterprise assistants, and intelligent knowledge applications. You can use these same techniques with your own data to create systems that don't just search, but reason over information and provide explainable, trustworthy answers.
