    "- `AzureBlobKnowledgeSource` automatically indexes documents from Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "- **Minimal extraction** (Steps 3-7): Fast, basic text extraction suitable for simple documents\n",

    "- **Reasoning effort levels** (Step 11-12): Medium effort enables iterative retrieval with more comprehensive results\n",

    "## 📝 Summary: How to Configure Chunk Size & Overlap\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** The Knowledge Source Python API doesn't expose `chunkingProperties` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** Use the Azure AI Search REST API to directly modify the skillset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Parameter | Range | Recommended for Tables | Why |\n",
    "|-----------|-------|----------------------|-----|\n",
    "| `maximumLength` | 300-50,000 chars | 1,000-2,000 | Small enough to keep 5-10 table rows together |\n",
    "| `overlapLength` | < maximumLength/2 | 10-20% of max | Ensures table headers repeat across chunks |\n",
    "| `unit` | characters | characters | Only supported unit |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Custom Chunking:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use smaller chunks (1,000-1,500) when:**\n",
    "- Documents have many tables\n",
    "- Tables are wide (many columns)\n",
    "- You need precise retrieval of specific table rows\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use larger chunks (3,000-5,000) when:**\n",
    "- Documents are mostly narrative text\n",
    "- You want broader context per chunk\n",
    "- Tables are simple (2-3 columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use overlap (200-500 chars) when:**\n",
    "- Tables span multiple pages\n",
    "- You need context across chunk boundaries\n",
    "- Table headers should repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify skillset** → Add `chunkingProperties` via REST API\n",
    "2. **Reset indexer** → Clear existing chunks\n",
    "3. **Run indexer** → Re-process documents with new settings\n",
    "4. **Verify** → Check chunk sizes are within expected range\n",
    "5. **Query** → Test if retrieval improved for table-heavy queries"
