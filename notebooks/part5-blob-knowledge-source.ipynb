Zava also needs to restore archived data from magnetic tape, a time-intensive process. The hardware in Zava's enterprise storage system was nearing its end of life and replacing it would be very expensive.As part of its business need to scale down its on-premises datacenters, Zava chose to upgrade to SQL Server 2016 because of the Stretch Database hybrid feature and its seamless integration with Azure. Stretch Database allows Zava to move the cold data in its tables from on- premises to cloud storage, freeing up local disk space and reducing maintenance. Both hot and cold data are in the same tables and are always available to applications and their users and for maintenance, such as backups and restores.Zava used these steps to move their historical data to the cloud:1 Analyze databasesPerformed an analysis of the tables in the databases that they intended to move to the cloud and fixed any issues.

    "- `AzureBlobKnowledgeSource` automatically indexes documents from Azure Blob Storage\n",
    "- **Minimal extraction** (Steps 3-7): Fast, basic text extraction suitable for simple documents\n",
    "- **Standard extraction** (Steps 8-12): Uses Azure AI Services for advanced document understanding and better chunk quality\n",
    "- Standard extraction is beneficial for complex documents with tables, images, or intricate layouts\n",
